							<h1> USER AGREEMENT </h1>
							<p>This USER AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") covers Fyinance, Inc. (“Fyinance”). This entity may be referred to as "we," "us," and "our" throughout this Policy.</p>
Introduction
Thanks for choosing Fyinance. By signing up or otherwise using the Fyinance service, websites, and software applications (together, the “Fyinance Service,” “Online Service,” or “Service”), or accessing any content or material that is made available by Fyinance through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Fyinance Inc.
The Fyinance Service includes social and interactive features. Use of the Fyinance Service relies on several technical requirements.
Your agreement with us includes these Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”) and our Privacy Policy. (The Terms, Privacy Policy, and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section, are referred to together as the “Agreements”.) If you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the effective version of the Agreements can be found on Fyinance’s website. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them. If you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Fyinance Service.
Please read the Agreements carefully. They cover important information about Fyinance Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. The Agreements include information about future changes to the Agreements, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy information, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.
Any information that you provided during sign-up can be corrected during the sign-up process by returning to the previous screens and correcting erroneous information.
In order to use the Fyinance Service and access the Content, you need to (1) be 18 or older, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) be resident in a country where the Service is available. You also promise that any registration information that you submit to Fyinance is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.

Changes to the Agreements
Occasionally we may, in our discretion, make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate the Agreements by contacting us through the Customer Service contact form.

You acknowledge and agree that posting any such content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your Fyinance account. You also agree that Fyinance may also reclaim your username for any reason.
Please be thoughtful about how you use the Fyinance Service and what you share. Remember that shared or publicly available information may be used and re-shared by other users on Fyinance or across the web, so please use Fyinance carefully and be mindful of your account settings. Fyinance has no responsibility for your choices to post material on the Service.
Your password protects your user account, and you are solely responsible for keeping your password confidential and secure. You understand that you are responsible for all use of your username and password on the Service. If your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe there has been unauthorized access to your account by third parties, please notify us immediately and change your password as soon as possible.
Payments and cancellations
Paid Subscriptions can be purchased either by (1) paying a monthly subscription fee; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Fyinance Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).
Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased as a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Fyinance (or to a third party through whom you purchased the Paid Subscription) will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period. However, if you cancel your payment or Paid Subscription and/or terminate any of the Agreements before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.

Fyinance may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, Pre-Paid Period (for periods
not yet paid for) from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Fyinance Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Fyinance Service prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.
Customer support
For customer support with account-related and payment-related questions (“Customer Support Queries”), please submit a ticket to our customer service department using the Customer Service contact form on the About Us section of our website. We will use reasonable attempts to respond to all Customer Support Queries within a reasonable time frame but we make no guarantees or warranties of any kind that any Customer Support Queries will be responded to within any particular time frame and/or that we will be able to satisfactorily answer any such queries.
Service limitations and modifications
Fyinance will make reasonable efforts to keep the Fyinance Service operational. However, certain technical difficulties or maintenance may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions. To the extent permissible under applicable law, Fyinance reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Fyinance Service, with or without notice, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Fyinance Service or any function or feature thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees for Paid Subscriptions that Fyinance permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments amd cancellations section), Fyinance will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation. You understand, agree, and accept that Fyinance has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service. This section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.
